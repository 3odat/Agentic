Perfect—here’s a realistic, detailed report of what each file does, how to run it and read its outputs, how it powers your agent, and what I recommend enhancing next.

# 1) `internal_latest.py` — PX4 Telemetry Service (FastAPI)

## What it does

* Connects to PX4 through MAVSDK, subscribes to telemetry (battery, GPS, position, velocity, attitude, health, status/armed/flight-mode, RC, heading, wind). It maintains a live snapshot, prints a readable dashboard, writes JSON, and serves **`GET /sensors`** via FastAPI.&#x20;
* The FastAPI app returns the current `monitor.snap` with NaN→None conversion, so JSON stays clean.&#x20;
* Structured async: spawns tasks per stream; runs monitor and Uvicorn concurrently. &#x20;

## How to run & get output

```bash
python internal_latest.py --url udp://:14540 --hz 1.0 \
  --json mavsdk_sensor_snapshot.json --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

* HTTP: `GET http://localhost:8001/sensors` → live snapshot (also prints to console and writes the JSON file you set). &#x20;

## Output shape (high level)

* `battery {voltage_v, current_a, remaining}`; `gps {num_satellites, fix_type}`;
  `position {lat_deg, lon_deg, abs_alt_m, rel_alt_m}`; `velocity_ned`;
  `attitude {quaternion, euler_deg{roll_deg,pitch_deg,yaw_deg}}`;
  `status {armed, in_air, flight_mode}`; `heading_deg`; `wind`.   &#x20;

## How it benefits the agent

* **Truth source for pose/attitude/health**: everything else (vision fusion, planner safety gates) depends on this being clean and available. The vision node pulls `/sensors` to attach geo/yaw to detections.&#x20;
* **Action gating**: planner can check `status.flight_mode`, `gps.fix_type`, `battery.remaining` before takeoff or aggressive moves. The service already exposes these consistently.&#x20;

## Immediate enhancements

* Add precise **timestamps** per field (e.g., `position_ts`, `attitude_ts`) to improve fusion latency modeling (now it’s one top-level timestamp in the print path).&#x20;
* Optional **/healthz** and **/metrics** (Prometheus) for uptime & alerting.
* If available from MAVSDK, expose **GPS accuracy** (HDOP/VDOP) to inform planner risk.

# 2) `soso.py` — Visual Perception Node (ROS 2 + tiny HTTP server)

## What it does

* Subscribes to camera/depth, runs detection, computes 3D positions, overlays labels, keeps a rolling buffer of frame records, and serves a **tiny HTTP API**:

  * **`/scene`**: most-recent window (counts + current GPS/yaw header + detections)
  * **`/history`**: the older slice of the same rolling window
  * **`/detections`**: legacy history format
  * **`/take_photo`**: saves the latest displayed frame to disk (returns filename)
    (Windows default: scene=5s, history=5–10s) &#x20;

* The HTTP handlers build responses by flattening detections from buffered frames and attaching a “global” header with `gps` + `yaw_deg`. &#x20;

* **`/take_photo`** writes `photo_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg` using the last displayed frame (RGB→BGR if needed).&#x20;

* It queries **`http://127.0.0.1:8001/sensors`** to get the drone pose for geo-projection; helper `compute_estimated_global(...)` turns (x,y,z + gps+yaw) into `{lat,lon,alt}` when inputs are valid. &#x20;

## How to run & get output

* Run as a ROS 2 node; if `rclpy` not present it won’t start. Then hit:

  * `GET http://<host>:8088/scene` → live snapshot window
  * `GET http://<host>:8088/history` → older slice
  * `GET http://<host>:8088/take_photo` → saves annotated frame; returns filename
    (ports/flags are parameters; defaults shown in the file.) &#x20;

## Output shape (high level)

* **Scene/History JSON**:

  ```json
  {
    "global": {"timestamp": ..., "gps": {"lat":..., "lon":..., "alt":...}, "yaw_deg": ..., "window_sec": ...},
    "count": <int>,
    "summary_by_object": {"person": 3, "chair": 1, ...},
    "detections": [ { "Object Name": "...", "Position [x,y,z] (m)": [...], "estimated_global": {"lat":...,"lon":...,"alt":...}, "confidence": ... }, ... ]
  }
  ```

  (exact keys vary with detector; `estimated_global` is only present when inputs are valid.) &#x20;

## How it benefits the agent

* **Situational awareness**: `/scene` gives the planner a real-time, georeferenced snapshot with counts + current pose—ideal for triggers (“if person detected in the last 5s, go-to-orbit”).&#x20;
* **Temporal reasoning**: `/history` helps decide whether a target is persistent vs transient before committing to a move.&#x20;
* **Evidence capture**: `/take_photo` lets the planner or operator record proof at moments of interest (confidence overlay can be added—see enhancements).&#x20;

## Immediate enhancements

* **Add `/gps`**: expose a simplified list of `{Object Name, GPS:{lat,lon,alt}}` by aggregating the latest `estimated_global` per object label. (All ingredients exist.)&#x20;
* **Draw confidence on saved photos** (add conf text to overlay before storing).&#x20;
* **Basic tracking** (IDs + velocity/heading via nearest-neighbor or SORT/ByteTrack) to stabilize targets across frames for your Planner.
* **Time-sync**: include the `/sensors` timestamp per frame to reduce projection drift during fast yaw moves.&#x20;

# 3) `Agentic_Controller_v4.py` — Interactive PX4/MAVSDK Controller (REPL)

## What it does

* Auto-connects to `udp://:14540`, guards takeoff (connect if needed & arm), and exposes reliable motion primitives via REPL: **`goto`**, **`orbit`**, **`look_*`/`yaw_*`**. Orbit is “true 360°” (perimeter → tangent align → integrate yaw → correct to start-perimeter → optional return-to-center), with progress logs and a hard “snap-back” using `goto`. &#x20;

## How to run & get output

```bash
python Agentic_Controller_v4.py
# at the prompt:
takeoff 3
goto 47.397741 8.545644 504.0
orbit 5 ccw 1.2 return
look_down 90
```

* `goto` uses `action.goto_location(lat, lon, abs_alt, yaw)` and prints “enroute”.&#x20;
* `orbit` prints steps, integrates yaw with progress (25/50/75%), then corrects drift by jumping back to the recorded start-perimeter using `goto`. &#x20;
* REPL includes usage help and safe shutdown of offboard streams. &#x20;

## How it benefits the agent

* **Deterministic primitives**: the planner can chain `goto → orbit → photo` confidently because `goto` and `orbit` are explicit, logged, and self-contained. &#x20;
* **Robust orbit**: the yaw-integrated approach yields a clean, repeatable 360°—great for perimeter scans around a detected target before landing or RTL.&#x20;

## Immediate enhancements

* Add composite skills: **`goto_orbit(lat,lon,alt,r)`** (goto, then orbit, then hover) and **`square(side_m)`** (forward→right→back→left), which your planner can call as single actions.
* Add **pre-flight safety gates** (pull `/sensors` and block if GPS not OK or battery too low).
* Emit **structured JSON logs** per command (params, start/end, success/failure) for mission tracing.

## End-to-end flow (how they work together)

1. Start telemetry: `internal_latest.py` → `/sensors` with pose/attitude/health.&#x20;
2. Start vision: `soso.py` → reads `/sensors`, projects detections to **estimated\_global**, serves `/scene` + `/history` (+ `/take_photo`). &#x20;
3. Fly: `Agentic_Controller_v4.py` → run `goto` using the lat/lon from `/scene` (or future `/gps`), then `orbit`, then trigger `/take_photo` for evidence. &#x20;

---

## High-leverage recommendations (now vs. later)

### Do now (low effort, big payoff)

* **Add `/gps`** in `soso.py` to emit your simplified object→GPS list for the planner (same flavor you requested earlier).&#x20;
* **Confidence overlay** on `/take_photo` images (write conf text on the frame before saving).&#x20;
* **Pre-flight gates** in the controller using `/sensors` (block if `fix_type` poor, `remaining` low).&#x20;

### Next step

* **Tracking IDs + velocity/heading** in `soso.py` to stabilize targets; this unlocks “follow persistent target” behaviors.
* **Field timestamps** in `/sensors` and **time-sync** stamps in `soso.py` frames to reduce projection error during fast yaw or movement. &#x20;
* **Structured command logs** from the controller for audit and offline analysis.

If you want, I can implement: (a) `/gps` endpoint in `soso.py`, (b) confidence overlay, and (c) `goto_orbit` + `square` in the controller—so your Planner Agent can call everything with clean, minimal contracts from day one.
